📰 BART-Based Abstractive Text Summarization for News Articles
🚀 Business Objective
Text summarization condenses long content while retaining its core meaning—critical in NLP and data science. This project uses the BART model for abstractive summarization, generating high-quality summaries that may include rephrased or newly constructed sentences.

💡 Applications across industries:

Scientific Research

Financial Reports

Legal Analysis

Literature

Meeting Summaries

Programming Docs

📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 40,000 professionally written summaries of news articles.

Feature	Description
Title	Headline of the article
Summary	Human-written summary
URL	Link to the original article
Date	Publication date
Content	Full article text

🎯 Project Goal
To implement and fine-tune the BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer) model for abstractive summarization.

🛠 Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, transformers

Environment: Google Colab (for GPU support)

🔍 Methodology
1. Data Preparation
Load and explore dataset

Scrape content and preprocess data

2. Environment Setup
Install dependencies via requirements.txt

Enable GPU runtime in Colab

3. Model Development
Define custom Dataset and DataLoader classes

Use BARTForConditionalGeneration from Hugging Face

4. Model Training
Split data into train/test sets

Train using a custom trainer class

5. Summarization & Evaluation
Generate summaries

Evaluate using ROUGE metrics (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L)

6. Web App Deployment
Built with Flask

Summarize articles via a simple web UI
